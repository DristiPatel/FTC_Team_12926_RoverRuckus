    created method for robot to move right until it aligns with the gold block - GoldAlign()
    started programming autonomous class for actual movement of robot on the field
        strafe robot in front of the leftmost sample mineral (problems with strafe: hardware?)
        GoldAlign() method for robot to align with gold block

11/20/18 - Dristi
    tested DogeCV GoldAlignDetector class and implemented program for robot
    to follow the gold block and stop when aligned with the gold block

    added Vuforia to robot to detect the Navigation Targets
    added autonomous methods to strafe at any degree or turn for a period of time


11/18/18 - Dristi
    Added DogeCV and openCVLibrary libraries and made them dependencies of TeamCode

        gradient speed implementations

10/25/18 - Dristi
    speedModifiers added (slow,fast)
    added methods for control of lift, arm, and grabber,
    added position enums

10/23/18 - Dristi/Hanaa
    added trig implementation for mecanum wheels
    added references to lift, arm extension and rotation, and collection motors

10/16/18 - Dristi
    created Autonomous & TeleOp folders,
    created HardwareRobot class
        declared and initialized DcMotors for mecanum wheels
